# 1. todo-neo Introduction
A full-stack todo application featuring advanced implementations such as software design principles, design patterns, OAuth authentication, and integrations with external APIs.

The name comes from the *neocortex*, the part of the brain responsible for planning, organizing, and managing tasks. It plays a key role in helping us reduce stress by bringing clarity and structure to our daily actions.

## 1.1. Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app that demonstrates my skills while also helping me learn how to *integrate external APIs* and implement security features such as *authentication and authorization*. It’s also designed to deepen my own understanding of the technologies I’ve studied over the past months at the university.

Additionally, I wanted to put into practice the **design principles** and **design patterns** I’ve been learning, applying them wherever they are recommended and make sense. At the same time, I aim to *avoid over-engineering* (**YAGNI principle**) and keep the project as simple as possible (**KISS principle**). I believe that *simplicity* and *code-readability* are essential parts of creating a high quality product.

## 1.2. Tech-stack

- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Backend:** Java (Spring framework)
- **Frontend:** TypeScript (React & CSS Tailwind)
- **Architectural patterns:** Monolithic application with a Layered Architecture

I will also include **Swagger** for API documentation, **Docker** for containerization, and **JUnit** for testing.
